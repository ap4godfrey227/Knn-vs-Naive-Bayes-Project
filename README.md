# Machine-Learning-Project-1
Weather data project I completed for my machine learning class by comparing k nearest neighbors and naive bayes classifier to see which was a better predictor


# Project Overview
* Developed multiple methods to try and predict the weather of Phoenix, Arizona based on 30 years of daily weather data.
* Implemented a model to predict the temperature using the k nearest neighbors method.
* Trained a supervised model to guess the season of a given weather data point using a naive-bayes classifier.
